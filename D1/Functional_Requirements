This is the first draft of functional reuirements. It covers mostly all the FRs from the project description. The goal now is to come up with the use cases, design their tables and diagrams, and then add the missing FRs.

FR-01 - Shelter staff can interact with animals
FR-01-01 - Shelter staff can add animal
FR-01-02 - Shelter staff can view detailed profile of a selected animal
FR-01-03 - Shelter staff can edit animal profiles

FR-02 - Shelter staff can interact with clients
FR-02-01 - Shelter staff add a new client
FR-02-02 - Shelter staff view the detailed profile of a selected client

FR-03 - Shelter staff control the ACM
FR-03-01 - staff members can launch the execution of the ACM algorithm 
FR-03-02 - staff members can view the resulting matches.

FR-04 - Clients can view the detailed profile of a selected animal

FR-05 - Clients can view their own client profile
FR-05-01 - Clients can view their own personal information
FR-05-02 - Clients can view their own matching preferences

FR-06 - Clients can edit their own client profile
FR-06-01 - Clients can edit their own personal information
FR-06-02 - Clients can edit their own matching preferences

FR-07 - ACM algorithm generates an optimal set of match results
	FR-07-01 - match results must contain a summary of matches
	FR-07-02 - match results must contain details of a selected match

FR-08 - ACM algorithm provides a summary of results
	FR-08-01 - must indicate the names of the matched pairs of animals and clients
	FR-08-01 - must specify the exact rules that were used to compute that match
	FR-08-03 - must specify data supporting how and why that specific match was computed

FR-09 - User can log in 
FR-10-01 - If username does not exist, error prompt 
FR-10-02 - If username does exist, login to that userâ€™s profile
FR-10-03 - Check whether user is shelter staff or client

FR-10 - Shelter staff can create their account
	FR-10-01 - verify the username is available
	FR-10-02 - on success, bring back the user to the login screen
