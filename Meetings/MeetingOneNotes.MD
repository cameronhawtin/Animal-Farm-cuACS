## 16th Jan 2019 Meeting #1

### Important guidelines from the project description:
* An optimal set of matches will take into account the best interests of all animals in the shelter, rather than producing a small subset of highly favourable matches and a large number of lesser compatible ones.
* ACM algorithm will be evaluated based on the variety, originality, and appropriateness of its matching rules and attributes.
* The ACM algorithm uses the profiles of all clients and animals in order to compute the best possible set of matches between animals and clients
* Shelter staff members can add new clients and launch the execution of the ACM algorithm to view the resulting matches.
* Match results must consist of both a summary of matches, and the details of a selected match. The summary information indicates the names of the matched pairs of animals and clients. The detailed information for a given match specifies the exact rules that were used to compute that match, as well as the data supporting how and why that specific match was computed.
* Data must be stored in persistent storage (flat files or SQL database) and loaded into the UI when cuACS launches. Modifications to data in the UI must be saved to persistent storage after every change.
* The cuACS system must be delivered already configured with a minimum of 25 complete animal profiles and 20 complete client profiles.
* In addition to the basic physical attributes (type of animal, breed, gender, age range, etc), the algorithm must use a minimum of 12 (twelve) separate and unique non-physical attributes.
* All the attributes defined in the animal and client profiles must be used by the algorithmâ€™s rules to compute the best matches.

### Important dates 
* D1 - feb 12
* D2 - march 5
* D3 - march 21
* D4 - april 9

### D1 (feb 12) must contains:
