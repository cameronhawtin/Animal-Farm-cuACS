Description:
The Carleton University Animal Care System (cuACS) proposes to address this issue by providing a tool that automatically matches together, 
based on compatibility, shelter animals and the human clients who wish to adopt them. The goal of the cuACS system is to generate an optimal 
set of matches, where a match consists of an animal available for adoption and a human client who is well suited to adopt it. An optimal set 
of matches will take into account the best interests of all animals in the shelter, rather than producing a small subset of highly favourable 
matches and a large number of lesser compatible one.

Launching and operating:
Navigate to the correct diretory (cuACS) using the "cd" command appropriately.
1. To compile, write "make". This uses the commands in the Makefile to make an executable called "cuACS"
2. To run the cuACS system, run the exectuable using the command: "./cuACS".
3. To login as the shelter staff, enter "Staff" as username and hit 'OK' (Please note that "Staff" is case-sensitive)
4. To login as a client, enter a client name (ex. "Christine Laurendeau"). These client names can be found when logged in as Staff, through the "View Clients" button. (Please note that these names are case-sensitive)
5. To exit, hit the close window button on the top right corner

FOR DELIVERABLE 3, PLEASE NOTE: 
The feature to edit an animal is done through the "View Animals" view when logged in as Staff. There will be a button present to edit the current animal selected; this button will not be available when logged in as a client.
